11. ### Interview Experience

> {{< collapse summary="Expand" >}}

2 Rounds were offline and one was online. Rounds had both DSA/CP type questions and Googlyness (HR Behavioural) questions. I'd say CP type questions were from 1500-2000 rated on Codeforces, and questions were both of classical DSA and some constructive ideas types. So a strong CP profile would be helpful here I think.
