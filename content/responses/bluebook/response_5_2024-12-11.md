OA had 3 sections CS Fundamentals, Aptitude and Programming
Each of the sections and each of the programming problems were separately timed i.e., you could not go back to any previous problem once you have moved ahead.

3 programming problems, 2 were on graphs and 1 on dynamic programming. I solved 2 completely and one partially.

CS fundamentals and Aptitude were medium-ish but key was to solve them quickly

We also had discussion on in depth OOPS, like virtual keyword, dynamic/static casting. I was also asked to a LLD of salary and increments of a people in a organisation based upon there roles

Round 2 - Initially the interviewer asked me about my summer internship and projects. Then I was asked 2 programming problems and again the interviewers were only interested in the logic. Then I was asked in depth on CS Fundamentals - OS, DBMS .
