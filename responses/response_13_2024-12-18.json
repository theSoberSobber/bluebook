      "I was asked only one question of array that I have given an array of odd and even numbers and I need to bring all the odd numbers in front maintaining their orders. But the cache was to do this in O(n) time complexity and using constant space. I tried a lot in front of interviewer but failed to do in o(n) and then I told that this question can't be done in asked time complexity and explained the reason to him. These took 40 minutes and then he said time is over so he ended up the interview. He was not looking satisfied and I was also disappointed, because I thought if he has asked me to optimise it then there must exist such solution. But later when I tried to search for the optimised solution, I was right that it can't be done in O(n) and constant space. At night results were declared and I got selected for that company. I was shocked how one can select on the basis of only one question. But that was Gods plan or maybe I had a good luck."
