Placement season is not just about hard work but also luck plays an important role. Some candidates face rejections even after performing well, while others clear their first interview with ease. There are always students who are exceptionally talented but still struggle to clear interviews. This does not reflect their abilities or potential. So, don?t be disheartened if you don?t clear your interviews or OAs. Stay focused, keep working hard, and success will be assured.
