Round 1:

There were two interviewers, both from Boston, Massachusetts, USA. My interview was scheduled at 10 PM.

The interview began with questions about my resume. Since I had mentioned RabbitMQ (a Message Broker), the first 5?10 minutes focused on an in-depth discussion about it. Once the interviewers were satisfied with my responses, we moved on to the next part of the interview.

This round aimed to assess my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and basic SQL implementation.

I was given two tables:

Employee Table
Attributes: EmpId, Salary, FirstName, LastName
Role Table
Attributes: EmpId, Position, StartDate, EndDate
The first question was: "How will you implement these tables in Object-Oriented Programming? You can use any OOP language."

I used C++ and created two classes: Employee and Role.
The follow-up question was to code and print all the roles of a particular employee.
Initially, I solved it by creating two objects.
Then, I was asked to do it using only one object. I achieved this by storing a vector of Role class instances within the Employee class.
Next, I was asked to write a program to print all employees currently working in the company.

After the coding part, we discussed C# and C++ briefly.

I was then given two basic SQL queries:

1.Find the sum of salaries of all employees currently working in the company.
This required an INNER JOIN between the Employee and Role tables.
2.Query using  GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.
I solved both queries successfully, which concluded the round.


Round 2: System Design
This was a system design round.

I was given three services: Order Service, Product Service, and User Service.
The task was to explain how I would design the system.

Since I had worked on a similar project, I shared the tech stacks that could be used. The interviewers were impressed.

They then provided an API response containing order details and asked: "As a developer, how would you proceed?"

I explained the importance of validation, such as:
Checking if the user is authenticated.
Ensuring the response contains valid currency.
Verifying the order sum matches the sum of individual items.
Validating the objects in the response.
Next, the interviewers asked about JWT (JSON Web Token) and its working, which led to an in-depth discussion.

For the database part, they asked:

Which type of database would you use and why?
I suggested SQL and provided valid reasons why NoSQL was unnecessary in this case.
We discussed the number of tables required and the foreign key relationships.
Since we had some time left, additional questions included:

The differences between SQL and NoSQL.
How to securely connect to databases, especially while providing a username and password.
I suggested using an .env file.
When asked how to secure the credentials without using .env, I proposed encryption and explained the algorithm, which impressed them.
We also discussed:

Cloud computing: Managing database or server downtimes.
Load management: Strategies for handling loads while deploying into the CI/CD pipeline.
This round was very specific to work scenarios and practical implementation.

Keep learning and growing. Rejections are part of the journey, but what truly matters is learning from your mistakes and improving each time. While hard work and smart work are essential, it?s important to acknowledge that sometimes luck can play a role too. However, consistent effort will eventually lead to success?when all the stars align, your moment will come.

For instance, in my case, I had three pending interviews that were canceled because there was only one vacancy, and the interviewers chose to proceed with me. Had my interview been scheduled later, I might not have had the same opportunity.

So, keep believing in yourself and stay persistent. Your hard work will pay off, and success will surely come your way one day!
