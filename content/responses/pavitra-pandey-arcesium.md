Round 1 - Interviewer asked 1 leetcode problem, search in rotated sorted array. Then we had in depth discussion on OS. Threads, cache, memory management we discussed. Also since I and the interviewer belonged to electronics background, we also talked about microprocessor, RISC and CISC, ARM and x86.

Round 2 - Asked about OOPS, OS, DBMS in depth. Also asked a SQL query that used self joins. Then we had a discussion on projects. Then the interviewer asked this [problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-celebrity-problem/). I came up with a O(n) time and O(1) space solution for it.

Round 3 - I was asked to design a class implementation on vectors, why it's size gets doubled etc., also we then discussed a lot on pointers and c++ in specific. Then the interviewer asked a trie problem which was trivial and well known. 

Round 4 - HR round, asked the normal HR questions. Apparently this round was eliminative too
