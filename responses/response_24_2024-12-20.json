      "Round 1 - Technical - Online\nThe first round started with an introduction about me. This was followed by 3 question related to dsa/cp. \nFirst question was a codeforces div2 B/C level question. The question asked to find the minimum number of moves required to make all the elements in the array unique. In one move you can increase the value of any element by 1.\nThe 2nd question was a dynamic programming question based on kanpsack pattern. Given a set of doors. Behind each door is some amount of gold and each door has a number written on it. If you choose a door with number 5 then you can pick gold from the next 5 doors. Find the maximum amound of gold you can pick.\nThe 3rd question was a situation based dsa question. I was required to find a suitable data structure to use in the situtation and explain my reasoning behind the choice.\nAfter the dsa question i was asked to discuss a project from my resume. \nThe 4th question was a OOPs question to model the realtion between batsmen, bowler and all rounder using classes. Since i used c++. They asked me about the diamond problem.\nThe next few questions were about operating systems. The question were about context switching, system call etc. \n\nRound 2 - Technical - Offline\nThe first and only dsa question in this round was [Sum of subarray minimums](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subarray-minimums/).\nThe question was followed by questions from operating system concepts deadlock, seamaphore, and computer networking topics such as network congestion and dns.\nThis was followed by a behavioural question about how i would resolve conflicts within a team, how would i manage a task with a short deadline and some question regarding things from my resume.\n\nRound 3 - HR - round\nThe HR asked my about my CP ratings on various platforms. Why would i like to join DE shaw and certain other behavioural questions."
