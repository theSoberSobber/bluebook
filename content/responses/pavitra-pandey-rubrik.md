13. ### Interview Experience

> {{< collapse summary="Expand" >}}

Round 1 (1 hour)  - Was asked this [problem](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1404/B). I came up with the observations and coded the solution. The round went smoothly.

Round 2 (1 hour) - The problem I was given was something like - You are given a tree, each node of the node has a string written on it like - "+ x" or "- x".
You from root to each of the nodes in the tree, when you encounter "+ x" increase the frequency of "x", else decrease. 
For each node - i, go on path from "root" to "i" and calculate the least positive frequency number. 
 I came up with n log n solution using map and set quickly but the interviewer insisted on a O(n) solution using MFU cache and linked lists.

Round 2 - Although I wasn't able to make it to round 3, but my friends have given it. It is a 15-30 mins Engineering Manager round, the questions are based on your resume and they also ask typical HR questions.
