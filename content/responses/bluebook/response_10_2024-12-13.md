12. ### Interview Experience

> {{< collapse summary="Expand" >}}

1st Round they asked my favorite CS topic, I said DSA and qsns were based on it. A classic DSA prob with lot of variations, all LC types. I guess they were satisfied with my DSA since I answered it all, and 2nd round was deep discussion of my projects, how and why I designed them the way I did, and relevant CS topics. There were also discussions on deployment and CI/CD.

14. ### Tips/Sources for Interview Preparation

> {{< collapse summary="Expand" >}}

GS can ask anything they want you unlike some standardized interviews, so what you will be asked (DSA or CS or projects) will be completely based on interviewer. Best thing you can do is have a very thorough understanding of your projects, be good at DSA and have a good idea of Networks, OS and DBMS, and a little bit of system design (if possible).
